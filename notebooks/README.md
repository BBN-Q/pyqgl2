# QGL2 Sample Notebooks

The jupyter notebooks in this directory show a few uses of QGL2, relying on the QGL2 implementation of the QGL Basic Sequences. Note that these notebooks do not include QGL2 programs, but show using QGL2 programs.

Start with [QGL2 AllXY.ipynb], which will show how to create a 'Channel Library' and turn on debugging.
[QGL2 RabiAmp.ipynb] shows creating and supplying arguments, including specifying the axis descriptors, and requesting that the compiled QGL2 code be saved to a file.
[QGL2 RabiAmp-indirect.ipynb] shows a python program that runs a previously compiled QGL2 program.
[QGL2 RabiSingleShot.ipynb] shows turning on debugging within the QGL compiler.

See [src/python/qgl2/basic_sequences] for sample QGL2 code, including non-notebook uses of QGL2.
